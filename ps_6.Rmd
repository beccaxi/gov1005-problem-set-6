## Question 1: Sampling and Confidence Intervals

```{r 1, echo=FALSE}

# Here I write a function, create_deck(), which creates a deck of cards as a
# tibble with 52 rows and four columns: suit, value, points and name. (I list
# the value column first so as to mimic the table in the problem set
# instructions.) The cards are ordered by suit: diamonds, hearts, clubs, spades,
# and go from 2 to Ace within each suit. J, Q, K, and A each have a point value
# of 10, which I set using an ifelse() condition in creating the points column.
# The name column pastes the value and suit, separated by “of".

create_deck <- function() {
  tibble(
    value = rep(c(2:10, "J", "Q", "K", "A"), times = 4),
    points = ifelse(
      value == "J" | value == "K" | value == "Q" | value == "A", 
      10, 
      value
    ),
    suit = rep(c("diamonds", "hearts", "clubs", "spades"), each = 13),
    name = paste(value, suit, sep = " of ")
  )
}

# Here I write a draw_card() function which takes parameters n (how many cards
# to draw) and report (which column to return). First, the function calls
# create_deck() to set up the deck of cards, then calls sample_n() to sample n
# cards from the deck and selects the requested column. I end by calling pull()
# in order to convert the function output from a column to the desired format.

draw_card <- function(n, report) {
  create_deck() %>% 
  sample_n(size = n) %>%
  select(report) %>% 
  pull()
}
```

### 1A)

```{r 1A, echo=FALSE}

# I first set the seed to 2. I then call my draw_card function with n = 4 and
# report = “name”.

set.seed(2)
draw_card(n = 4, report = "name")
```


### 1B)

```{r 1B, echo=FALSE}

# Set the seed to 3. Make a tibble called “hands” that draws a sample (without
# replacement) of 5 cards, 100 times. Using map_lgl, create a column of your
# tibble called “face” which tests whether there are any face cards (J, Q, K) in
# the hand. Print a gt of the first 5 rows of your tibble, which should look
# like this:


```


### 1C)

```{r 1C, echo=FALSE}

# Set the seed to 2. Print a call to your draw_card function, where n = 4 and
# report = “name”.


```


### 1D)

```{r 1D, echo=FALSE}

# Set the seed to 2. Print a call to your draw_card function, where n = 4 and
# report = “name”.


```


### 1E)

```{r 1E, echo=FALSE}

# Set the seed to 2. Print a call to your draw_card function, where n = 4 and
# report = “name”.


```


### 1F)

```{r 1F, echo=FALSE}

# Set the seed to 2. Print a call to your draw_card function, where n = 4 and
# report = “name”.


```


### 1G)

```{r 1G, echo=FALSE}

# Set the seed to 2. Print a call to your draw_card function, where n = 4 and
# report = “name”.


```
